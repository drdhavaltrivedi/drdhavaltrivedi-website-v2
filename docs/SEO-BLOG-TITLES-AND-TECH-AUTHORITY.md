## 3. Authority building strategy

### Backlinks
- **Guest posts:** Tech/AI blogs (e.g. "How AI is used in traditional practices" by Dr. Dhaval Trivedi) with link to drdhaval.in and/or /about.html.
- **Vedic/astrology portals:** Contribute articles or get listed in "expert" or "consultant" directories with consistent NAP and link to drdhaval.in.
- **Academic/PhD:** Link from university profile or research page to official site (drdhaval.in).
- **Harvest backlinks:** Find unlinked mentions of "Dhaval Trivedi" or "Dr Dhaval" and request a link to the official site or about page.
- **Podcasts / interviews:** Appear as "Dhaval Trivedi, AI Expert and Vedic Astrologer"; ensure show notes link to drdhaval.in.

### PR & positioning
- **One-liner:** "Dr. Dhaval Trivedi is an AI Expert and Vedic Astrologer who bridges cutting-edge technology and ancient Vedic sciences."
- **Press releases:** Any new offering (e.g. new consultation package, tech product) with link to homepage and relevant service page.
- **Quotes:** Offer expert quotes to journalists on AI + ethics, or astrology/numerology trends; bio link to drdhaval.in.

### Google Knowledge Panel
- **Consistency:** Same name ("Dhaval Trivedi" / "Dr. Dhaval Trivedi") and sameAs URLs everywhere: official site, Wikipedia (if created), LinkedIn (add to Person schema when profile URL is confirmed), YouTube, X, Instagram.
- **Official site:** Ensure Google knows drdhaval.in is the official site (Schema.org sameAs, Google Search Console).
- **Wikipedia:** If eligible, create or update article with one sentence on AI + Vedic Astrology and link to drdhaval.in (references required).
- **Google Business Profile:** If he has a consultation practice or physical presence, create/claim and link to drdhaval.in.

### Outranking other "Dhaval Trivedi" profiles
- **Entity consolidation:** One primary entity = "Dr. Dhaval Trivedi" with drdhaval.in as the main URL. Use that name + "AI Expert", "Vedic Astrologer", "Numerologist" in titles, meta, and content.
- **Content depth:** More comprehensive, E-E-A-T-rich content on drdhaval.in (about page, service pages, blog) so Google prefers it as the "official" and most informative result.
- **Signals:** More quality backlinks to drdhaval.in than to other profiles; consistent sameAs and mentions from reputable sites.
- **Featured snippets:** Target FAQ and how-to snippets (see blog titles above) so drdhaval.in appears in position zero for long-tail queries that include "Dhaval Trivedi" or "Dr Dhaval".
