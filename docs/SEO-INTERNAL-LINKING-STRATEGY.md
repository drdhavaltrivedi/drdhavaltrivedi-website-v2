# Internal Linking Strategy – Dr. Dhaval Trivedi / drdhaval.in

**Goal:** Strengthen topical authority for "Dhaval Trivedi", "Dr Dhaval Trivedi", "Dhaval Trivedi AI Expert", "Dhaval Trivedi Astrologer", "Dhaval Trivedi Numerologist", "Dhaval Trivedi Vedic Astrology", "Dr Dhaval AI" through clear silos and consistent anchor text.

---

## 1. Anchor text strategy

- **Exact / primary:** Use "Dhaval Trivedi", "Dr. Dhaval Trivedi", "Dr Dhaval Trivedi" on homepage, about, and key entry pages (1–2 times per page).
- **Variants (natural):** "Dhaval Trivedi AI Expert", "Dhaval Trivedi Astrologer", "Dhaval Trivedi Numerologist", "Dhaval Trivedi Vedic Astrology", "Dr Dhaval AI" in intro content, about page, and blog.
- **Service anchors:** "Vedic Astrology", "Jyotish", "Numerology", "Vastu", "Palmistry", "AI consulting" when linking to service pages.
- **Avoid:** Over-optimisation (e.g. same keyword in every link). Prefer "consultations", "birth chart reading", "life path number" where it reads naturally.
